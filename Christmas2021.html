                <div class="p1">Lexi finished her first professional year with the Oswego City School District! After the school year, Lexi moved to Rochester with Derek, beginning her new position as a 2<sup>nd</sup> grade teacher with Schlegel Road Elementary in the Webster Central School District.
                On July 19<sup>th</sup> 2021, we adopted an Aussiedoodle from an Amish family; we named the newly adopted puppy Jax. Jax brought the bathroom indoors, many chewed chair legs, and sleepless nights; but created so much joy for the house.</div>
                <div class="p1">In all, 2021 was a great year for us with many milestones and accomplishments accompanied by many obstacles. We look forward to the new year and seeing what is next for us! Enjoy your Christmas and happy New Year!</div>
