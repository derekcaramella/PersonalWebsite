            <p class="p1">Derek finished his senior year at Elmira College - triple majoring in Economics, Business Administration, & Political Science minoring in Mathematics and concentrating in Public Affairs. Derek left his 2-year position with Pladis Global, a chocolate factory, as a Digitization Lead to begin his Masters of Data Science at the University of Rochester. During Derek's studies, Derek picked up a full-time position as a UX Functional Analyst with Tiber Creek consulting working with the military.
                Lexi finished her first professional year at Oswego City School District! After the school year, Lexi moved to Rochester with Derek and began her new position teaching 2<sup>nd</sup> grade with Schlegel Road Elementary in the Webster Central School District.
                On July 19<sup>th</sup> 2021, we adopted an Aussiedoodle from the Amish family; we named the newly adopted puppy Jax. Jax brought  the bathroom indoors, many chewed chair legs, and sleepless nights; but some much joy to the house.
                In all, 2021 was a great year for us with many milestones and accomplishments accompanied by many obstacles. We look forward to the new year and seeing what is next for us! Enjoy your Christmas and happy New Year!</p>
